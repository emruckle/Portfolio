# Hamster Alert

This project leverages a Raspberry Pi and a passive infrared (PIR) sensor to detect when a hamster is awake and active in its cage. When the PIR sensor detects movement, a text message is sent to a specified phone number using the Python SMTP library and Verizon's email-to-SMS service. This project highlights my proficiency in Python and my experience with embedded systems.

- Technologies Used: Raspberry Pi, Python, PIR Sensor, SMTP.
- Description:
    - Movement Detection: Utilized a PIR sensor to monitor the hamster's activity.
    - Notification System: Implemented a Python script to send text alerts via email-to-SMS when movement is detected.
- Skills Demonstrated: Embedded systems, sensor integration, Python programming, real-time notifications.
