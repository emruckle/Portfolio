# Portfolio
A collection of course and personal projects showcasing my skills and experience in various programming languages and technologies. See each individual project folder for more in depth information.

## fasterr (Fall '24)
- Technologies Used: Java
- Description: Developed the fasterr R package to optimize the performance of three widely used R functions by rewriting them in C++ using Rcpp. This package accelerates data processing workflows while maintaining consistent functionality.

## Mega Tic Tac Toe (Summer '24)
- Technologies Used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Description: Designed a web-based Tic Tac Toe game with an extended grid for a more challenging experience. This project showcases my skills in web development and interactive user interface design.

## MIPS Paint (Summer '24)
- Technologies Used: MIPS Assembly
- Description: Created an MS Paint-inspired drawing application for the Nintendo 64. This project highlights my skills in MIPS Assembly Language, graphics programming, and understanding of the N64 architecture.

## Smart Shell (Spring '24)
- Technologies Used: C, Unix System Calls
- Description: Built a custom Unix-like shell with support for command execution, input/output redirection, and piping. The shell includes fun built-in features like random haikus and an asterisk heart printout. This project showcases my understanding of process management, system calls (fork(), execvp(), wait()), and inter-process communication.

## Hamster Alert (Spring '24)
- Technologies Used: Embedded Systems, Raspberry Pi, Python
- Description: Developed an alert system using a Raspberry Pi to monitor hamster activity. The system utilizes sensors and Python scripts to detect movement and send notifications.

## Lempel Ziv Decoder (Spring '23)
- Technologies Used: C
- Description: Implemented a decoder for the Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm. The project involves decoding a stream of encoded bits back into the original data, demonstrating proficiency in low-level data processing.

## Reverse Wordle (Fall '23)
- Technologies Used: C++, R, Rcpp
- Description: Developed a word-guessing game where the roles are reversed: the computer tries to guess the player's chosen word. This project demonstrates my abilities in Java programming and algorithm development.
