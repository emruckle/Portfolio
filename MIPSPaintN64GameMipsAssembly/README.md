# MIPS Paint

This project is an MS Paint-inspired drawing application developed for the Nintendo 64 gaming console. It includes multiple gameplay modes (draw, erase, move), as well as a color selection feature. It can be played on the Nintendo 64 console using a programmable cartidge, or on a video game emulator such as Ares. This project is written in MIPS Assembly, and PeterLemon's N64 Github repository was an inavluable resource. Most of the files in the LIB folder are .INC files written by PeterLemon. Some of his macros are used throughout my project, with credit given to him both here, and in inline comments. COLORS16.INC and COLORS32.INC were written by fraser125 on Github.
