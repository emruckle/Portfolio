# Lempel Ziv Decoder

This project focuses on building a decoder/decompressor for a dictionary-based compression algorithm called LZ78, based on work by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv published in 1978. The decoder reads compressed data from a file, interprets it according to the LZ78 algorithm, and outputs the decompressed text. This version scans bytes directly from the file.

Technologies Used: C

Description:
- Dictionary based compression
- File handling
- Efficient memory management
  
Skills Demonstrated: Backend development, C programming, algorithm implementation, file I/O, dynamic memory management
